##Deployment Plan

1. Spin up basic server
	* Single-Tier server
	* the most taxing thing the server will hold is images. Therefore the basic droblet plan should be enough. (I certainly couldn't use more than 500MB on *just* images right?)

2. Figure out how to get site content onto the server's IP
	* Configure server for git development
	* Test with a basic page
	* Hope it works (it if doesn't then cry)

3. Make basic static site
	* This will act more as a template/skeleton for the final portfolio

4. Push basic site to the server

###Site polishing
1. Features
	* Add image previews for each project
	* Carousel view for each project

2. Test it
3. Push site to the server
